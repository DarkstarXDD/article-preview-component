### Built with. üî®

- HTML & CSS.
- TypeScript.
- Vite.

#

### New Things Learned. üéì

- To allow images to scale beyond their original file dimensions, you have to use `width: 100%` rather than `max-width: 100%`. For example, an image sized at `576px X 576px` won‚Äôt expand beyond `576px` if `max-width: 100%` is applied.
- Inline SVGs need to have the `viewBox` attribute. Without it, the SVG won‚Äôt scale with the browser‚Äôs root font size, even if you‚Äôve set its `width` and `height` in `rem` within CSS.

#

### Testing and Accessibility. üß™

- Tested site usability with keyboard-only navigation.
- Used the Responsively App to check the site's appearance on various screen sizes, from 320x480 to 3000x2000.
- Set the browser font size on desktop to various values ranging from 9px to 72px to make sure everything on the site scales properly with the user's preferred browser font size.
- Zoomed the page in and out using Ctrl + Scroll wheel (up to 500%).
- Tested with the NVDA screen reader.
- Viewed the site on an iPhone 11 in both portrait and landscape modes.
- Performed Lighthouse and PageSpeed tests. ([PageSpeed Result.](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-article-preview-component-darkstarxdd-vercel-app/9y06oyno2b?form_factor=mobile))
